However, the Group retained a clear focus on securing value from its operational structure and its extensive and diverse asset base; and it is now reaping the benefits, following the Group recapitalisation and the significant increase of gas production. The Company has a broad asset base across the exploration, development and production phases of the business. These assets have significant upside potential and we now have the financial strength to de-risk and mature these assets over the coming years, while also looking for valuable opportunities for asset acquisition.William HiggsChief ExecutiveMediterranean Oil & Gas Plc (MOG or the Company) is pleased to announce its results for 2011.The year 2011 has seen transformational developments on the financial and operational fronts. The Group recapitalisation completed in May left MOG free of financial debt with  a cash and cash equivalent position of 17 .5m at 30 June and 3.7m at 31December 2011. This was a positive step in enabling the Company to embark on its growth objectives by funding first gas at Guendalina while remaining debt free. The development of the Guendalina gas field (20% MOG W.I.) has been completed successfully and gas production started on 25 October 2011, providing the Company with a sound revenue base going forward.

This was largely due to the commencement of gas production at the Guendalina gas field in late October 2011. During 2011, the Brent oil price has been relatively constant at around $110/bbl,  while the Euro vs US Dollar exchange rate has experienced significant fluctuations which have strongly influenced the gas price received by the Group under its gas sales contracts. The average gas sales price achieved during the period was 0.32/scm ($12.7 per thousand cubic feet); higher than in 2010, when the average gas sales price was 0.28/scm ($10.7 per thousand cubic feet). The Companys forecasts for future gas prices indicate that this positive trend is expected to continue in 2012.

In this E&P acreage the existing production is not the only value. In fact, several interesting development and exploration projects are also present, mainly within existing production concessions that have the potential to unlock approximately 12 to 14 Bcf net unrisked prospective resources to the Group and achieve new near to mid-term gas production. During the period: a review of residual onshore gas exploration potential has been undertaken. In the first half of 2012, management will complete the ranking of the prospects with the goal of drilling wells over the next three years to regenerate reserves and production from this element of the portfolioOil & Gas Reserves and Resources The Groups reserves and resources  are reviewed on an annual basis by independent certifiers (Proven, Probable and Possible Reserves) and/or by the Company (Contingent and Prospective Resources). The following tables summarise the evolution of the Groups hydrocarbon reserves and resources since 2006 and includes the latest update, as at 31December 2011.At the end of 2011: 2P Oil Reserves & Resources remained substantially unchanged  the 2P RRR (Reserves Replacement Ratio) for the gas is around 105%, which means that the Company has successfully replaced all production from 2011 in the reserves ledger the Companys R/P ratio for gas is 14.7 2P Gas reserves increased due to the annual revision of the Groups onshore gas fields reserves performed by SIM and the new independent certification of Guendalina Gas Reserves by RPS  Gas Prospective Resources also increased, on average 42%, as a result of the review of the gas exploration potential performed on the Italian and French E&P Assets Net Oil Reserves & Resources in MMbblsReserves Proven plus Probable (2P) MMbblsBest Estimate Contingent Resources MMbblsHigh Estimate Contingent Resources MMbblsProspective Resources (unrisked) Best Estimate MMbblsProspective Resources (unrisked) High Estimate MMbbls1 July 2006 012927021,57734,447330 June 2007 012927021,29143,614430 June 2008 2011221921,41943,951431 December 2008 2011221921,41943,951431 December 2009 2011221921,41943,951431 December 2010 4011221921,40543,920431 December 2011 4011222121,40543,92041: Independent certification by SIM. 2: Company assessment. 3: RPS assessment. 4: RPS assessment except for Company assessment of Monteardone and Monte Grosso with total of 74 MMbbls best case and 109 MMbbls high case.Net Gas Reserves & Resources in BcfReserves Proven Plus Probable (2P) (Bcf)Contingent Resources Best Estimate (Bcf)Contingent Resources High Estimate (Bcf)Prospective Resources (unrisked) Best Estimate (Bcf)Prospective Resources (unrisked) High Estimate (Bcf)1 July 2006 12121250220244230 June 2007 111252612702138230 June 2008 101252552932158231 December 2008 171252552932158231 December 2009 16.51252552932158231 December 2010 17.61252552482120231 December 2011 18.4122.3248286215621: Independent certifications by SIM and RPS (Guendalina 2012 only). 2: Company assessment. 11Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTS some field revamping and new development projects have progressed, which will enable 2 to 3 Bcf net 2P reserves to be progressively placed on production within the next 12 to 24 monthsItaly  OffshoreThe Companys development efforts during the period under review were all focused on the Guendalina gas field offshore Italy in the northern Adriatic.Guendalina Gas Field (MOG W.I. 20%,  ENI W.I. 80% and Operator)At Guendalina: the development activities included the installation of the production platform, drilling of two production wells, installation of all production infrastructure and start-up of gas production the drilling campaign confirmed the previously discovered gas-bearing sand levels and identified some minor new gas-bearing intervals The Company: entered a gas sales contract with the Italian Utility Elettrogas SpA to cover all the Companys net gas produced from the field undertook an independent certification of the field gas reserves that post reporting date: revised 2P recoverable reserves of 31.2 Bcf (6.2 Bcf net to MOG), representing an increase of 42% relative to the previous pre-development valuation of 22 Bcf (4.4 Bcf net to MOG) estimated P3 reserves of 40.3 Bcf (8.1 Bcf net to MOG) provided an economic valuation of MOGs 2P net reserves, in which the NPV, using a 10% discount rate, is 27 .2 millionThe Guendalina gas field is located 47km offshore of the north-east coast of Italy, in 42m of water. The field is performing in line with our pre-development forecasts, with an average gross production of 580,000 scm/day for the 1st Quarter of 2012 (MOG 116,000 scm/day). The Guendalina project represents a game changer milestone for the development  of the Company. It significantly increases the Companys net production up to the equivalent of about 950 boe/day and provides revenues for at least the next  4-5 years, with further potential upside  to follow.Other North Adriatic Gas Discoveries (MOG W.I. 15%)The Guendalina project is inside one of the most important gas exploration and production areas in Italy and is situated 70km to the south of four other discovered, but still undeveloped, offshore gas fields in which the Group has a 15% interest (ENI, Operator). These four gas discoveries amount to between 19 to 48 Bcf net contingent gas resources to the Group and represent an important growth opportunity for the Company. Their reclassification from 2C (Contingent Resources) to 2P reserves is expected to take place following authorisation of the development plans for the fields. Development activity for these fields has been frozen since 2001, pending the resolution of environmental concerns about developing the offshore region. The Italian Government indicated in 2009 that it is in favour of a positive resolution of these issues in this area of the Northern Adriatic. A portion of the Companys A.C 19.PI concession lies within 12 miles of nature reserves and therefore may, in part, be impacted by the 2010 offshore restrictions introduced by the Italian Government for the offshore E&P activities. As the majority of the fields lie outside the 12 mile boundary, the Company expects the operator, ENI, to review the status of the concessions and subsequently, to present a field development plan.Ombrina Mare Oil & Gas Discovery  (MOG W.I. 100%)The Ombrina Mare discovery is an important asset for the Company that, despite the offshore restrictions introduced for offshore E&P activities by the Italian Government in 2010, represents an important future growth opportunity. Following the successful drilling of two exploration/appraisal wells in 2008, the completion of a well as an oil producer and the set-up of a tripod platform in preparation for the development phase, the Company applied for a production Concession (d 30 B.C-MD) in December 2008.On 23 June 2009, the FDP project received technical approval from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MED). On 3December 2009, the project was submitted to the Italian Ministry of the Environment (ME) for issuance of the relevant Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Issuance of the EIA by the ME is a precondition for the MED to grant the production Concession. The Company obtained in early 2010, an independent certification of 40 MMbbls 2P oil reserves, of which proven (P1) oil reserves were just over 12 MMbbls. These oil reserves establish the Ombrina Mare field as a significant European oil project. Since June 2010, following the issuance of Italian Legislative Decree no. 128/2010 (the Decree) prohibiting E&P activities in certain sea and Italian coastal areas, there remains some uncertainty over the Groups ability to progress the Ombrina Mare project. The Decree provides, among other things, that the limitation does not apply to titles that, as at the date it came into force, had already been granted (i.e. enabling titles). The Italian Government has yet to clarify whether the Companys interest held at Ombrina Mare falls within the exemption of an enabling title. The Company is continuing its active dialogue with the Italian Government, with a view to securing positive clarification of the Groups title and/or obtain appropriate modifications to the text of the Decree. In addition, the Company is also working with external legal counsel on the analysis and implementation of alternative courses of action as a contingency plan.In February 2012, Law Decree 5/2012, regarding simplifications and economic growth was published in the Official Journal of the Republic of Italy clarifying that the limitations provided by Decree 128 do not apply to either existing mining titles or relevant extensions. This Decree was ratified in law on 6 April 2012 (Law 35/2012). Following this, we were pleased to receive a 3 year extension to our exploration permit BR269 GC, where the Ombrina Mare field is located, in May of this year and see this as a positive sign in our ongoing discussions with the Italian authorities regarding the issuance of a production concession for our proposed development of the Ombrina Mare field.  12Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comChief Executives report continuedSince 2008, the Company has completed  a detailed G&G assessment of the area, in order to de-risk the prospects and verify the presence of technically and commercially valuable exploration drilling opportunities. With this objective in mind, in late 2011 the Company acquired 1,012 sq km of high resolution long offset 3D seismic data on the most prospective sector of Area 4. The Company believes that this 3D data will  be fundamental to completing the G&G assessment and de-risking the exploration potential. A comprehensive CPR has been commissioned. The results of this study, which are expected early in the 3rd Quarter of 2012, will underpin the Companys strategy to seek a farm-in partner  and progress the exploration of this interesting acreage.FranceThe St. Laurent permit is located in southern France in a known gas and oil prone province. The Company has an 11% W.I. in this asset. In 2011, a detailed review of the gas play was completed in the permit area, which showed the presence of a number of high risk but high potential gas leads. The acquisition of 400km of infill 2D seismic has been planned for 2012 to supplement existing seismic data and complete a more proper definition of the leads and de-risk this exploration potential. The strategy for the licence will be decided following the analysis of this data. Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE)The Company continues to be committed to maintaining the highest standards in HSE management. No injuries or environmental incidents have been reported for the period under review. Since 2008, the Company has set up policies and procedures to conduct business in a safe, healthy and ethical manner. In 2011, the Company developed policies and procedures to achieve compliance with the UK Bribery Act and extended these principles to all the subsidiaries of the Group.  Wildcat ExplorationItalyIn the Southern Apennines, the Group operates the Monte Grosso project, holding a 22.89% interest. The project is a high quality near field exploration opportunity close to one of the largest onshore oil producing areas in Western Europe. The Monte Grosso 2 exploration project presently remains on hold, pending resolution of residual permitting issues, which the Group presently believes should be positively resolved and allow a project start-up in mid 2014 (subject to rig availability). The Monte Grosso 2 well  is targeting 280 MMbbls of unrisked prospective resources (64 MMbbls net to the Group) at a depth of 6,500m. Permitting and existing well site maintenance works were the main activities conducted during the period.Offshore MaltaThe Group operates Area 4 Offshore  Malta (MOG W.I. 90%). Area 4 comprises approximately 5,700 sq km of deep water acreage north of the internationally-recognised border between Malta andLibya.The area is frontier exploration where no drilling activity has occurred and it is one of the rare areas that still remains to be explored in the Mediterranean basin. It is a high risk, but potentially a high reward geological environment where 9 prospects have been identified by RPS with a total of 1,500 MMbbls of unrisked prospective oil resources. The Malta Production Sharing Contract (PSC) was signed with the Maltese Government in July 2008. In May 2011, the Company agreed an 18 month extension  to the first exploration period of the PSC with the Maltese Government, thus extending the first exploration period  until mid-January 2013. The Company  also announced the planned farm-out  of a 75% W.I. to Dominion Petroleum Limited (Dominion), subject to the approval of Dominions shareholders. Dominion was unable to secure the necessary approval and exercised its right to terminate the transaction.  13Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSOperational OverviewMOG has a broad portfolio of production, development and exploration assets and a secure financial position. Revenues from gas sales are now providing a sound financial position going forward.Over the next 12 months, MOG intends to progress its key assets and pursue attractive and material strategic growth opportunities that we expect to identify.One of the strengths of the Company is the wide international experience of its senior managers, in particular in the Mediterranean area and the operational capability of its staff and organisation. This has been preserved during the critical period of financial uncertainty in 2011 and we believe that it is now a key strength for the ambitious growth objectives of the Group.William Higgs Sergio MorandiChief Executive,  Chief Operating Officerappointed 19 March 2012  (interim Chief Executive,  up to 18 March 2012)24 May 2012 24 May 2012Qualified person:In accordance with the guidelines of the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange,  Dr Bill Higgs, Chief Executive of Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc, a geologist, explorationist  and reservoir manager with over 23 years oil and gas industry experience, is the qualified person as defined in the London Stock Exchanges Guidance Note for Mining and Oil and Gas companies, who has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this announcement.GlossaryBcf Billion cubic feet of gasContingent oil/gas resources Has the meaning ascribed by the SPE/WPC StandardMMbbls Million stock tank barrels of oilMMscm Million standard cubic metresP1 & P2 Reserves Proven plus probable reserves as defined in the SPE/WPC StandardProspective oil/gas resources Has the meaning ascribed by the SPE/WPC StandardScm Standard cubic metreSPE/WPC Society of Petroleum Engineers/World Petroleum CongressSPE/WPC Standard Definitions and methodology for certifying hydrocarbon reserves and resources adopted by the SPE/WPC from time to time which presently requires the application of the 2007 Petroleum Resources Management System standardsRRR Reserve Replacement RatioR/P Reserves to Production Ratio  14Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comFinancial review2011 highlights New equity raised, post cash transaction expenses, 22.4m Cash and cash equivalents at year-end of 3.7m (2010: 2.8m) Financial liabilities at year-end nil (2010: 20.4m) Group revenue from sales of gas and gas condensate 5.6m (2010: 3.5m) Group profit before tax of 2.8m (2010: 7 .8m loss)RevenueIn 2011, gas and gas condensate production of 17 .6MM scm (0.62 Bcf) resulted in a 62% increase in operational revenues to 5.65m (2010: 3.49m). A 44% increase in gas production relative to the prior 12 month period (2010: 12.3 MM scm; 0.43 Bcf) was primarily attributable to the commencement of gas production at the Guendalina offshore gas field in late October 2011. The average gas sales price realised in 2011 was 0.32/scm, or $12.7 per thousand cubic feet (2010: 0.28/scm or $10.7 per thousand cubic feet). This is reflected in the cash generated from operating activities which, at 1.05m, exceeds the previous year (2010: (1.48m)).Income From OperationsThe loss from operations for 2011 was 1.7m (2010: loss of 5.5m). The reduced loss was primarily attributable to the combined effect of increased revenues in 2011 relative to 2010, together with lower total administrative expenses of 5.7m (2010: 7 .5m).The reduction in total administrative expenses arose from a lower impairment expense of 1.1m in the year (2010: 3.4m), which was largely attributable to an impairment provision of 586,000 for the Torrent Cigno concession (Masseria Vincelli 1 and Torrente Cigno 4 wells) and 457 ,000 for the Lucera concession (Reggente, Bastia and Santa Caterina fields).Group RecapitalisationOn 21 April 2011, the Company announced its financial restructuring, which was completed on 10 May 2011 (Group Recapitalisation). This transaction comprised the settlement of the credit facility held with the Bank of Scotland (BoS) and conversion of all outstanding convertible bonds and loan notes to equity, eliminating approximately 20.4m in financial debt from the statement of financial position. At the same time, approximately 22.4m in new equity (post cash transaction expenses) was raised, with the Group having a net cash and cash equivalent position of 17 .5m, at 30 June 2011. Following completion of the Group Recapitalisation, the Group held no financial debt and held sufficient funds to, among other things, fund the Groups 20% working interest in the Guendalina project, which first commenced gas production at the end of October 2011. MOG expects to remain in a sound funding position following full disbursement of capital expenditures required to complete the Guendalina field and the material increase in the Groups revenues arising from the commencement of production at Guendalina.Chris KelsallFinance Director 15Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSNet ProfitTotal finance expense for the year was 1.7m (2010: 2.8m). No interest expense was incurred following the elimination in May of financial debt, as part of the Group RecapitalisationTotal finance income in the year was 6.2m (2010: 482,000). This was largely caused by a one-off finance gain of 5.7m on the settlement of financial liabilities, arising as part of the Group Recapitalisation. The foreign exchange income of 435,000 arises predominantly from the translation of items held in foreign currencies to the Euro reporting currency of the financial statements.Profit before tax was 2.8m (2010: loss 7.8m). Following the commencement of first gas at Guendalina, a deferred tax asset of 3.7m was recognised in the year with regard to tax losses brought forward. These are expected to be applied against taxable profits arising from future oil and gas production, most notably at the Guendalina gas field. As a consequence, the Group net profit after tax was 6.4m (2010: loss 7 .8m). The basic and diluted earnings per share was 0.02 per share (2010: loss of 0.20 per share). No dividend is proposed to be paid for the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: nil).Cash FlowNet Group cash inflow generated from operating activities was 1.0m (2010: 6,000 net outflow).Prior to completion of the Group Recapitalisation in May 2011, the Group  was required to reduce operational and exploration activity, except where this was considered to be essential to preserve the Groups key assets.Net cash investments in oil and gas assets in the year were 17 .8m (2010: 3.7m), the main elements comprising capital expenditure on the Guendalina project and the acquisition of 3D seismic data at Area 4 Offshore Malta.Net cash from financing activities was 17 .8m (2010: 575,000) and primarily comprised 22.7m gross cash proceeds received from the issuance of new equity (2010: nil) and the payment of 3.9m  (2010: nil) for settlement of the BoS loan facility, both items forming part of the  Group Recapitalisation.Statement of Financial PositionCash and cash equivalents at year-end were 3.7m (2010: 2.8m). Among non-current assets, key movements from 2010 included property, plant and equipment at 20.5m (2010: 3.6m), primarily as a result of capital expenditure on the Guendalina project, and the recognition of a 3.7m deferred tax asset, following the commencement of first gas production at Guendalina.Financial liabilities at year end were nil (2010: 20.3m), following the Group Recapitalisation. The increase in provisions to 8.4m (2010: 6.7m) was primarily attributable to a new decommissioning provision (1.2m) being made in the year following the commencement of production from the Guendalina gas field (see Note 19 of the Financial Statements for further information).At the end of 2011, net assets stood at 51.6m (2010: 11.8m), and non-current assets were 55.8m (2010: 35.2m).Key Performance IndicatorsThe Groups key financial performance indicators are revenue and consolidated result. Its key non-financial performance indicators are the level of production and reserve and resources replacement (discussed in the Chief Executives Report Oil & Gas Reserves and Resources on page 10) and the health, safety and environmental performance (discussed  in the Chief Executives Report  HSE, on page 12).The share price movement during the 12 month period to 31 December 2011 ranged from an intra-day high of 25.4p (prior to the Group Recapitalisation) to a low of 5.8p (post the Group Recapitalisation). The share price at close on 31 December 2010 was 6.1p.Events after the Reporting PeriodIn November 2011, the Company entered into a short-term secured loan facility with affiliated investment funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (Och Ziff), for up to 3.5m (the Loan Facility). The purpose of the Loan Facility was to assist the Company in funding the acquisition and processing of 3D seismic exploration data at Area 4 Offshore Malta. Draw downs under the Loan Facility at  31 December 2011 amounted to nil (December 2010: nil). Subsequent to the reporting date, on 7 February 2012, the Company borrowed 2.0m (the Principal) under the Loan Facility. Repayment of the entire Principal and accrued interest was completed on 26 April 2012 (For further information, refer to Notes 1, 25 and 26  to the Financial Statements). HedgingDuring 2011, the Group did not have any oil and gas price derivatives in place (2010: no oil and gas price derivatives in place).Cautionary StatementThis financial report contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the usual risk factors and uncertainties associated with the oil and gas exploration and production business. While the Directors believe the expectation reflected herein to be reasonable in light of the information available up to the time of their approval of this report, the actual outcome may be materially different owing to factors either beyond the Groups control or otherwise within the Groups control but, for example, owing to a change of plan or strategy. Accordingly, no reliance may be placed on the forward-looking statements.Chris KelsallFinance Director24 May 2012  16Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comPrincipal risks and uncertaintiesThe Group is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those which derive from its oil and gas exploration, development and production activities. These risks and uncertainties may have a material impact on the Groups performance and could cause future results to differ materially from expected and historical resultsHealth, Safety and EnvironmentThe Group conducts operations in countries in Europe and the Mediterranean region. There is a risk of incidents in our operations that have the potential to impact the health and safety of staff, contractors, and communities, and/or the environment. Such incidents may have a negative impact on the Groups reputation. This risk is mitigated through the implementation of the Groups HSE management system, training of staff, and selection of contractors.The Group is extremely conscious of the environmental risks that are inherent in  the oil and gas industry. The Group  ensures that all relevant environmental impact studies are undertaken in  advance of any proposed seismic or other operations it undertakes and best-in-class industry environmental standards and practices are adopted by the Group in  all of its operations. While the Group can never fully mitigate the cost, delays and other implications of future changes in environmental legislation and regulation, the Group establishes strong working relationships with the local authorities  in the countries it operates to be best able to work through any potential significant changes that could arise in the future.Funding and FinancingThe nature of the Groups business means that there are significant costs associated with seismic, drilling, and development campaigns. The Group manages this risk by a number of means. The Group closely monitors its cash position and each month produces updated cash flow forecasts to help it determine appropriate strategies to fund its short and medium-term operations. The Group also ensures that it always has adequate levels of cash on deposit, with varying terms of maturity, to match the items of expenditure as they become due. Further information on pricing, liquidity and credit risk is set out in Note 19 to the Financial Statements. The Groups principal risks and uncertainties are set out below, together with a summary as to how they are mitigated. The relative importance of  the risks faced by the Group is likely to change over time as the Group implements its growth strategy and as a consequence of external political, regulatory and macroeconomic developments.Exploration There is no assurance that the Groups exploration activities will identify a commercial discovery among the existing portfolio. The Group mitigates exploration risk through the experience and expertise of the Groups specialists, the application  of appropriate technology, and the selection of prospective exploration  assets. The Group has an objective to acquire additional exploration assets, which will diversify exploration risk. Furthermore, the Group seeks to employ individuals and contractors with strong technical skills and experience in the areas in which it operates. Where appropriate, the Group works with joint venture partners who have demonstrable technical skills and experience in similar projects. Further information on exploration assets is set out in Note 5 to the financial statements.OperationsThe nature of oil and gas operations means that the Group is exposed to the  risk of equipment failure, well blowouts,  fire, pollution and bad weather. In order  to mitigate these risks, the Group ensures that it implements recognised industry operating and safety standards, it has sufficient levels of industry-specific insurance cover and it only works with  joint venture partners, operators and contractors who can demonstrate similar high standards of safety, operating and financial capability. 17Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSCurrenciesThe functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the Euro and a significant proportion of its current portfolio of assets and near-term forecast revenue and expenditure is also in Euro. Certain expenditures are required to be funded in Pounds Sterling and US Dollars and the Group monitors its forecast expenditure profile and maintains sufficient levels of its cash resources in Pounds Sterling and US Dollars to pay these expenses. The Group does not believe, at this moment, it is particularly exposed to large currency fluctuations. The Group holds a significant proportion of its cash reserves with banks which have a minimum credit rating of A. Further information on currency risk is set out in Note 19 to the financial statements.RegulationRegulations may change with a consequential adverse effect on the Groups exploration and production assets. Regulatory risk is mitigated by monitoring the regulatory and political environment within the countries in which the Group holds assets, engaging in constructive dialogue where and when appropriate, and introducing third-party expertise if this may assist in resolution of issues affecting the Groups assets. The Group has an objective to acquire additional assets both for the exploration and production portfolio, which may assist in diversifying country-specific regulatory risk.Risk ManagementThe Directors regularly monitor the principal and other related risks, using information obtained or developed from external and internal sources, and will take action as appropriate to mitigate the Groups exposure. The main elements of the risk management system include regular Board review of the business, a defined process for preparation and approval of  the annual work programme and budget, ethical and anti-bribery procedures, and HSE management systems.The Group reviews its business risks and management systems on a regular basis and, through this process, the Directors have identified the principal risks. The Group manages some risks by maintaining a portfolio of projects and ensuring the Group is in compliance with the terms of all its agreements, through the application of appropriate policies and procedures and via the recruitment and retention of a team of skilled and experienced professionals.  18Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com1.2. 4.3. 5. 7.8.9.6.Board of Directors 19Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTS3.

While the Company is not required to present a Corporate Governance Statement, as it is not subject to the Listing rules of the Financial Services Authority, it has disclosed here certain information in respect of Corporate Governance.The Directors, however, support high standards of corporate governance and intend that the Company will comply with the provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code in so far as it is practicable for a company of its size. In addition, the Directors will progressively adopt best practices in line with the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code on Corporate Governance, so far as is practicable.Board of DirectorsThe Company at the date of the Directors Report, has appointed six Non-Executive Directors (including the Companys Chairman) with relevant sector experience to complement the three Executive Directors and to provide an independent view to the Board. The composition of the Board ensures that no one individual or group dominates the decision-making process.The Board is responsible to the shareholders for setting the direction of the Company through the establishment of strategic objectives and key policies. The Board meets on a regular basis and considers issues of strategic direction, approves major capital expenditure, appoints and monitors senior management and any other matters having a material effect on the Company. The Board receives regular detailed financial and operational reports from senior management to enable it to carry out its duties. Each Director is entitled to independent professional advice at the Companys expense provided that the prior approval of the Chairman is obtained. All Directors have unrestricted access to management and to such Company information as is needed to carry out their duties and responsibilities fully and effectively. All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity following their appointment. In addition, Directors will retire by rotation and stand for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years in accordance with the Companys articles of association. The composition of the Board is reviewed from time to time to ensure that it has an appropriate balance of experience and expertise.Board CommitteesThe Board may establish committees to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. The current Board committees are the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Directors do not consider that, given the size of the Board, it is appropriate to have a Nominations Committee. The appropriateness of such a committee will, however, be kept under regular review by the Company.Audit CommitteeThe Audit Committee meets not less than twice a year and considers the Companys financial reporting (including accounting policies) and internal financial controls. Meetings are normally attended, by invitation, by the Finance Director and a representative of the Auditors. The Audit Committee presently comprises Michael Seymour (Chairman) and Salvatore Russo.Remuneration CommitteeThe Remuneration Committee comprises two Non-Executive Directors and is responsible for establishing and developing the Companys general policy on executive, senior management and employee remuneration and determining specific remuneration packages for Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee presently comprises: Salvatore Russo (Chairman) and Miles Donnelly. The Remuneration Committee meets at least once a year.Internal ControlThe Directors are responsible for the Groups system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. Any such system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Internal controls and business risks were monitored in the course of 2011 through regular Board meetings.Communication with ShareholdersThe Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for the performance and activities of the Group. The Annual Report together with other information about the Group is available on the Groups website at www.medoilgas.com  24Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comRemuneration reportFor the year ended 31 December 2011The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is comprised of Salvatore Russo (Chairman) and Miles Donnelly. The Committee is responsible for determining and making recommendations to the Board on the structure and overall remuneration package for Executive Directors and reviews the remuneration for the Companys senior employees. It is responsible for determining individual remuneration packages including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board on the basis of a proposal prepared by the Remuneration Committee. No Director may participate in any meeting at which discussion or any decision regarding his own remuneration takes place. The Remuneration Committee also administers the Companys share option scheme. The Committee keeps itself fully informed of all relevant developments and best market practice in the field of remuneration.The Remuneration Committee is permitted to appoint independent advisors to assist in the determination of the remuneration.Remuneration PolicyThe Committee, in forming its policy on remuneration, has given due consideration to the needs of the Company, the shareholders and the provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). The ongoing policy of the Committee is that the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality employees capable of achieving the Groups objectives and to incentivise them effectively, so as to deliver long-term shareholder value.It is the aim of the Committee to reward key employees on a basis which is linked, to a significant extent, to the performance of the individual and of the Company. Also, the remuneration is subject to the broader principle that their remuneration should be competitive with that received by professionals of comparable companies.There are four main elements of the remuneration package:\t Base salary\t Employee benefits\t Performance-related bonus\t Long-term share optionsBase SalaryThe policy is to pay a fair and reasonable base salary, taking into account comparative salaries for similar roles in similar companies. The base salary is reviewed annually by the Committee having regard to the performance of the Company, individual performance, market data, levels of increases applicable to other employees of the Company and economic conditions. The most recent salary review for Executive Directors was implemented on 1January 2012.Employee BenefitsSergio Morandi receives a car and fuel allowance. In 2011, no payments were made to personal pension schemes for or on behalf of the Executive Directors.The Company provides the Companys Directors and Officers with third party indemnity insurance.Bonus ArrangementsPerformance bonuses may be awarded to the Companys employees and Executive Directors by the Board, upon recommendation by the Remuneration Committee. Bonus payments are not pensionable. Details of Directors remuneration paid in the year under review are set out in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.Long Term Share Option SchemeOn 11 March 2010, the Board approved implementation of a new Global Share Option Plan (the Plan). No options were granted under the Plan in 2011. Following a recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, on 19 January 2012, 13,500,000 options were granted under the Plan to the employees and Directors over ordinary shares of the Company.On 19 March 2012, 6,000,000 options were granted under the Plan to William Higgs over ordinary shares of the Company.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This report is made solely to the companys members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.Respective responsibilities of directors and auditorsAs explained more fully in the statement of directors responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards (APBs) Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the financial statementsA description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APBs website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm. Opinion on financial statementsIn our opinion: \t the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the groups and the parent companys affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of the groups profit for the year then ended;\t the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;\t the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and\t the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.Emphasis of matter  Ombrina MareIn forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 5 to the financial statements concerning the carrying value of the Ombrina Mare asset, which is recorded in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 at 17 .9m. The uncertainty surrounding the application and relevance of Legislative Decree June no. 128/2010 to the Ombrina Mare asset has yet to be resolved by the Italian Government and therefore a material uncertainty as to the potential impact of the legislation on the carrying value of the Ombrina Mare asset exists. In the absence of definitive opinion on the impactof the legislative decree the directors have not recognised any provision for impairment against the carrying value of the Ombrina Mare asset.Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006In our opinion the information given in the directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Matters on which we are required to report by exceptionWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\t adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\t the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\t certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made; or\t we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.Anne Sayers(senior statutory auditor)For and on behalf of BDO LLP , statutory auditorLondonUnited Kingdom24 May 2010BDO LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales (with registered number OC305127).Independent auditors reportTo the members of Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc  27Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSNote2011 0002010 000Revenue 7 5,649 3,488Cost of sales (1,850) (2,021)Gross profit 3,799 1,467Other income 258 554Administrative expenses Depreciation, depletion and amortisation (1,395) (1,179) Impairment (1,086) (3,388) Other administrative expenses (3,236) (2,935)Total administrative expenses (5,717) (7,502)Loss from operations 8 (1,660) (5,481)Finance expense 2 (1,698) (2,784)Finance income 2 6,192 482Profit/(loss) before tax 2,834 (7,783)Tax credit/(expense) 11 3,598 (37)Profit/(loss) for the year and total comprehensive income attributable to the equity holders of the parent 6,432 (7,820)Earnings/(loss) per share attributable to the equity holders of the parent Basic and diluted 3  0.02 (0.20)The notes on pages 34 to 56 form part of these financial statements.Consolidated statement of comprehensive incomeFor the year ended 31 December 2011 28Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comShare Capital 000Deferred shares 000Share premium 000Contributed equity reserve 000Warrant and share option reserve 000Convertible debt reserve 000Retained Deficit 000Total 000GroupAt 1 January 2010 11,285  20,053  723 68 (12,701) 19,428Total comprehensive loss for the year       (7,820) (7,820)Share-based payments     217   217Lapse of options     (81)  81 As at 31 December 2010 11,285  20,053  859 68 (20,440) 11,825Total comprehensive income for the year       6,432 6,432Shares issued  fundraising (net of issue costs) 4,025  18,327     22,352Shares issued  settlement of convertible debt 469  2,331 8,111  (68) 68 10,911Share consolidation (10,721) 10,721      Share-based payment     39   39Lapse of options     (169)  169 As at 31 December 2011 5,058 10,721 40,711 8,111 729  (13,771) 51,559The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within owners equity:Reserve Description and purposeShare capital Amount subscribed for ordinary share capital at nominal value.Share premium Amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value.Contributed equity reserve An amount representing equity contributed directly by shareholders.

set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS. The Companys functional currency is the Euro and it has adopted the Euro as its presentational currency.

At 31 December 2011, the Group had net assets of 51.6m and net current assets of 4.1m. On 8 November 2011, the Company entered into a short-term secured loan facility with affiliates of certain of its substantial shareholders, namely affiliated investment funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (Och Ziff), for up to 3.5m (the Loan Facility). The purpose  of the Loan was to assist the Company in funding the acquisition of 1,000 sq km of 3D seismic exploration data, in relation to its licence commitment at Area 4 Offshore Malta, under the Malta Production Sharing Contract signed with the Maltese Government on  18 July 2008 and its Addendum signed on 17 May 2011. Draw downs under the Loan Facility at 31 December 2011 amounted to nil  (31 December 2010: nil). Subsequent to the reporting date, on 7 February 2012, the Company borrowed 2.0m (the Principal) under  the Loan Facility. Repayment of the entire Principal and accrued interest thereon was completed on 26 April 2012 (Refer to Notes 25 and 26, for further information).Management has prepared cash flow projections which reflect the effect of the recapitalisation and indicate that the Group can continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due and meet minimum spend commitments on its licenses for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of the financial statements.Basis of accounting and adoption of new and revised standardsa) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2011:The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the Group for the financial year beginning 1 January 2011. Except as noted, the implementation of these standards did not have a material effect on the Group: Standard Impact on initial application Effective dateIFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liability with equity instruments This interpretation addresses transactions in which an entity issues equity instruments to a creditor in return for the extinguishment of allor part of a financial liability. The Group applied this interpretation from 1 January 2011.1 July 2010 IAS 24 (Revised) Related party disclosures The revised standard responds to concerns that the previous disclosure requirements and the definition of a related party were too complex and difficult to apply in practice, especially in environments where government control is pervasive. The Group applied the revised standard from 1 January 2011.1 January 2011Improvements to IFRSs (2010)The improvements in this amendment clarify the requirements of IFRSs and eliminate inconsistencies within and between standards. The Group applied the amendments from 1 January 2011.1 January 2011 Notes forming part of the financial statementsFor the year ended 31 December 2011 35Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSb) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted: Standard Effective dateIFRS 7 (Amendments) Disclosures  transfers of financial assets 1 July 2011IAS 12 (Amendment) Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets 1 January 2012*IAS 1 (Amendment) Presentation of items of other comprehensive income 1 July 2012*IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2013*IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2013*IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in other entities 1 January 2013*IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013*IAS 27 (Amendment 2011) Separate financial statements 1 January 2013*IAS 28 (Amendment 2011) Investments in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2013*IAS 19 (Amendment 2011) Employee benefits 1 January 2013*IFRS 7 (Amendment 2011) Disclosures  offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2013*IAS 32 (Amendment 2011) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014*IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2015** Not yet endorsed by the EU. The Group is evaluating the impact of the above pronouncements but they are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups earnings or shareholders funds.Basis of consolidationWhere the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own income statement in these financial statements. The Group profit for the year includes a profit after tax of 2.9m (2010: loss after tax 5.61m) in respect of the Company, this is dealt with in the financial statements of the Parent Company.Business combinationsThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained.Jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assetsThe Group includes the assets it controls, its share of any income and the liabilities and expenses of jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the terms of the underlying contractual arrangement.The Companys investments in subsidiariesIn its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost, less any impairment. The cost of acquisition includes directly attributable professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition.Revenue recognitionRevenue is derived from sales of oil and gas to third party customers and fees received from third parties in return for services associated with the operation of oil and gas fields owned in conjunction with other parties. Sales of oil and gas production are recognised at the time of delivery of the product to the purchaser which is when the risks and rewards of ownership pass. Sales of oil and gas services are recognised based on the services provided and the timing of the provision of those services.Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding at the effective interest rate applicable.TaxThe major components of tax on profit or loss include current and deferred tax.Current tax is based on the profit or loss adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when the tax relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity. 36Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com1 Accounting policies (continued)Deferred taxationDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs to its tax base.Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available, against which the difference can be utilised.The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).Oil and gas assets: exploration and evaluation The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for Exploration and Evaluation (E&E) costs, having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. Under the full cost method of accounting, costs of exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties are accumulated and capitalised by reference to appropriate cash generating units (CGUs). Such CGUs are based on geographic areas and are not larger than a segment.E&E costs are initially capitalised within Intangible assets. Such E&E costs may include costs of licence acquisition, technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred.Plant, Property and Equipment (PPE) acquired for use in E&E activities are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the extent that such PPE is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible E&E asset.Intangible E&E assets related to exploration licences are not depreciated and are carried forward until the existence (or otherwise) of commercial reserves has been determined. The Groups definition of commercial reserves for such purpose is proven and probable reserves on an entitlement basis.If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a CGU basis as set out below and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets is then reclassified as development and production assets within property, plant and equipment and are amortised on a unit of production basis over the life of the commercial reserves of the pool to which they relate. Intangible E&E assets that relate to E&E activities that are not yet determined to have resulted in the discovery of commercial reserves remain capitalised as intangible E&E assets at cost, subject to meeting impairment tests as set out below.E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist. Where the E&E assets concerned fall within the scope of an established CGU, the E&E assets are tested for impairment together with all development and production assets associated with that CGU, as a single cash generating unit. The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. Where the E&E assets to be tested fall outside the scope of any established CGU, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets concerned will generally be written off in full. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.A separate category of intangible asset being Gas storage assets have previously been shown representing the potential value of gas storage facilities within the portfolio. Assets are held at cost with impairment reviews conducted in line with the requirement of IFRS 6.Other intangible assets are held by the Group, being software and other licences. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost initially recognised and carried, of other intangible assets, in line with a reducing balance basis over the remaining expected useful life. Other intangible assets have been disclosed as part of exploration and evaluation.Oil and gas assets: development and productionDevelopment and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the decommissioning asset (see below) and the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above. They are presented as oil and gas properties in Note 4.The net book values of producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method by reference to the ratio of production in the period to the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account estimated future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is Notes forming part of the financial statements continuedFor the year ended 31 December 2011 37Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSgenerally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.DecommissioningWhere a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a field exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised from the outset. The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. Included within the relevant asset is an amount equivalent to the provision which is depreciated on a unit of production basis. Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated asset.Impairment of non-financial assetsNon-financial assets and identifiable intangibles, other than oil and gas assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the expected discounted future cash flow from the use of the assets and their eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recognised and measured using the assets fair value or discounted cash flows.Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assetsDepreciation is provided to write off the cost less estimated residual values, initially recognised and carried, of all property, on a reducing balance basis over their expected useful lives. Depreciation is calculated at the following rates:Plant and equipment  10% per annum range 10%  12%Financial assets and liabilitiesThe Groups financial assets consist of available for sale assets, and loans and receivables. There are no financial assets classified as held to maturity or at fair value through profit or loss.Available-for-sale: Non-derivative financial assets are classified as available-for-sale and comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. Unquoted available for sale investments whose fair value cannot be reliably valued are carried at cost.Loans and receivables:Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and cash held on current account or on short-term deposits (up to 90 days) at variable interest rates. Any interest earned is accrued monthly and classified as finance income.Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.The Groups financial liabilities consist of financial liabilities held at amortised cost, and held at fair value through profit and loss.Trade and other payables, which are initially stated at their fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. All interest and other borrowing costs are recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method and expensed as part of financing costs in the incomestatement.Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the movement in fair value being recognised in the income statement as they arise. Details of inputs into fair value calculations are available in note 18. All warrant derivatives have been extinguished in the current period.Convertible bondsWhere a convertible loan meets the definition of a compound financial instrument the component parts are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. The fair value on issue of the Groups convertible bonds was split into their liability and equity components on the basis of their fair value. The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that did not include an option to convert. Subsequently, the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost. The difference between the net proceeds of the convertible loan note and the amount allocated to the debt component is credited direct  to a separate equity reserve and is not subsequently re-measured. On conversion, the amount of fair value of shares issued has been recognised within share capital and share premium. The excess fair value of the debt settled has been recognised as contributed equity  as the debt holders are all shareholders who have acted in their capacity as shareholders for the benefit of the company. The Groups convertible bonds were renegotiated in 2007 , 2008 and 2009 and accounted for in accordance with this accounting policy. All convertible bonds have been settled in 2011.Foreign currencyTransactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate (the functional currency) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date.Share capital is denominated in Sterling and translated at historic rate. 38Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com1 Accounting policies (continued)Functional and presentation currencyItems included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is also the functional currency of the Company and its significant subsidiaries.Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in other income and expenses.Other provisionsA provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.Share-based paymentsThe Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the income statement is charged with the fair value of goods and services received.Options granted by the parent company to employees of subsidiaries are measured as equity-settled share based payments, and expensed in the company receiving employee services. No new equity-settled instruments have been issued during the year. Detail of those issued to management after the reporting date are set out in note 26. InventoriesInventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value.Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Oil and gas production flows directly into the national grid therefore there are no oil and gas inventories held. Leased assetsWhere substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group (a finance lease), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and is calculated so that it represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor (an operating lease), the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of lease classification.Joint VenturesThe Group includes the assets it controls, its share of any income and the liabilities and expenses of jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the terms of underlying contractual arrangements.Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).Under the full cost method of accounting for E&E costs, intangible costs are capitalised as intangible assets by reference to appropriate CGUs, and are assessed for impairment on a concession basis when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value and, therefore, there is a potential risk of an impairment adjustment. This assessment involves judgement as to: (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality should be determined; (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to any concession based on proved plus probable, prospective and contingent resources; and (iii) the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value.Notes forming part of the financial statements continuedFor the year ended 31 December 2011 39Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSFollowing the issuance of Italian Legislative Decree June, no. 128/2010 (the Decree) prohibiting certain exploration and production activities in selected sea and Italian coastal areas, there is some uncertainty over the Groups ability to progress the Ombrina Mare asset (Ombrina Mare) as previously scheduled, or at all. The current status of attempts to resolve this situation is detailed in Note 5.Ombrina Mare is recorded in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 at 18.0m. The Board has reviewed the current carrying value against certain criteria, including those applicable under IFRS 6 (Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources), and have concluded that no impairment of Ombrina Mare should be recognised for the year ended 31 December 2011. This conclusion is also based upon advice received from the Groups Italian legal counsel and recognising that the indicated resource at Ombrina Mare represents significant potential to the Group.Together with other members of the oil industry based in Italy, the Group is presently in discussions with relevant Italian government authorities in order to identify a solution to enable the development of Ombrina Mare. The Group will continue to monitor legislative changes closely and pursue avenues for legal recovery, should the situation merit such action.Key sources of estimation uncertaintyThe key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.(a) Impairment reviewsWhilst conducting an impairment review of its assets, the Group exercises judgement in making assumptions about future gas prices, reserves, rehabilitation costs, future development and production costs. Changes in estimate can result in significant changes to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The policy in respect of impairment reviews is set out above and details of reviews carried out during the year are set out in notes 4 and 5.(b) DecommissioningProvision was made in the accounts for future decommissioning costs to plug and abandon wells. The cost of provision should be added to the value of the development and production asset and depreciated on the unit of production basis. The decommissioning liability is stated in the accounts at discounted present value and accreted up to the final liability by way of an annual finance charge.The Group has potential decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests in Italy. The extent to which a provision is required in respect of these potential obligations depends, inter alia, on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the cost and timing of any necessary decommissioning works, and the discount rate to be applied to such costs. The decommissioning provision and how the cost is calculated are described in more detail in Note 19. (c) ReservesDevelopment and production assets (oil and gas properties) within Property, Plant and Equipment are depreciated on a concession basis using the unit of production method at a rate calculated by reference to proven plus probable reserves. These reserves have been determined using technical estimates of oil and gas in place and recovery factors. Future development costs are estimated using assumptions as to the number of wells required to produce the commercial reserves, the cost of such wells and associated production facilities, and other capital costs. The carrying amount of development and production assets at 31 December 2011 is shown in Note 4.(d) Deferred taxJudgement is applied in making assumptions about future taxable income, including gas prices, production, rehabilitation costs and expenditure to determine the extent to which the Group recognises deferred tax assets, as well as the anticipated timing of the utilisation of the losses.(e) Share based payment Refer to note 22 for the keys assumptions used in determining the value of Share based payments.2 Finance income and expense 20110002010000Finance incomeFinance gain on settlement of debt 5,707 Foreign Exchange Income 435 Bank interest received 22 32Change in fair value of derivative (Note 17) 28 4506,192 482Finance expenseCosts associated with financing transactions 418 Unwinding of discount on provisions 610 738Convertible debt 413 1,044Bank interest paid 257 453Loss on foreign exchange  5491,698 2,784 40Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com3 Earnings/(loss) per share  20110002010000NumeratorProfit/(loss) for the year 6,432 (7,820)DenominatorWeighted average number of shares used in basic EPS 290,140,596 38,912,736Potential ordinary shares are excluded on the grounds that they are non dilutive and can be found in Notes 17 and 25.Earnings/(loss) per share attributable to the equity holders of the parent Basic and diluted 0.02 (0.20)4 Property, plant and equipment Plant and Equipment000Oil and Gas Assets000Total000GroupCostAt 1 January 2010 1,431 11,109 12,540Additions 11 226 237Movement on decommissioning assets  (221) (221)Disposals (57)  (57)At 31 December 2010 1,385 11,114 12,499Additions and transfers* 6 18,002 18,008Movement on decommissioning assets  1,202 1,202At 31 December 2011 1,391 30,318 31,709Depreciation, depletion and impairmentAt 1 January 2010 (804) (5,760) (6,564)Charge for the year (148) (986) (1,134)Impairments (228) (1,097) (1,325)Disposals 1 119 120At 31 December 2010 (1,179) (7,724) (8,903)Charge for the year (10) (1,253) (1,263)Impairments  (1,043) (1,043)At 31 December 2011 (1,189) (10,020) (11,209)Net book valueAt 31 December 2011 202 20,298 20,500At 31 December 2010 207 3,390 3,597At 1 January 2010 627 5,349 5,976* PPE has seen a substantial increase in the year due to the commencement of production of AC 35 A.G (Guendalina field) transferred from intangible assets for a total net value of 2.493m and subsequent additions of 15.377m.Recognition of impairment lossesThe assets affected by impairment losses are oil and gas properties. Management reviewed the carrying values of all properties classified as PPE to ascertain the recoverability of values in respect of concessions where facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on value in use. A discount rate of 10% has been used in the value in use calculation which has been deemed appropriate given the risk profile of the Group.As a result of this exercise and due to natural depletion of fields, an impairment loss of 1.043m was recognised for PPE during the year and represents the impairment provision to bring the assets to their estimated recoverable value from sale or production. The impairments can be summarised as follows: 0.586m for the Torrente Cigno concession (Masseria Vincelli 1 and Torrente Cigno 4 wells) and an impairment provision of 0.457m for the Lucera concession (Reggente, Bastia and Santa Caterina fields).Notes forming part of the financial statements continuedFor the year ended 31 December 2011 41Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTS5 Intangible assets Gas storageasset000Exploration assets000Total000Company intangible assets000CostAt 1 January 2010 3,509 27,230 30,739 190Additions  2,707 2,707 Other movement  741 741 Impairment  (470) (470) (190)Movement on decommissioning asset (816) (422) (1,238) At 31 December 2010 2,693 29,786 32,479 Additions  4,057 4,057 Transfers to PPE  (2,493) (2,493) Impairment  (43) (43) Movement on decommissioning assets  (98) (98) At 31 December 2011 2,693 31,209 33,902 Amortisation and ImpairmentAt 1 January 2010 (1,119) (184) (1,303) Charge for the year  (45) (45) Impairment (1,574)  (1,574) At 31 December 2010 (2,693) (229) (2,922) Charge for the year  (132) (132) At 31 December 2011 (2,693) (361) (3,054) Net book valueAt 31 December 2011  30,848 30,848 At 31 December 2010  29,557 29,557 At 1 January 2010 2,390 27,046 29,436 190The intangible assets include all those costs incurred for the exploration and economical evaluation of potentially productive fields. In the prior period a gas storage asset held as intangible was written off to nil.Recognition of impairment lossesThe assets affected by impairment losses are oil and gas exploration and evaluation assets. Management review the carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets, classified as intangible assets pending evaluation of commercially viable reserves, to ascertain the recoverability of values in respect of concessions where facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on value in use. A discount rate of 10% has been used in the value in use calculation which is deemed appropriate given the risk profile of the Group.As a result of this exercise, an impairment loss of 43,000 was recognised against the intangible assets relating to the Settecerri exploration permit that was relinquished during the year (2010: 470,000). During the year, the Group has continued to seek clarification of the impact of Italian Legislative Decree June, no. 128/2010 (the Decree), prohibiting E&P activities in certain sea and Italian coastal areas. During 2011, the Italian legislature has issued no change or formal clarification in relation to the Decree. On 6 April 2012, Law Decree 5/2012 was ratified into Italian law. The new Law 35/2012 clarifies that the limitations provided by the Decree 128/2010 do not apply to either existing mining titles or relevant extensions. As a consequence of this, in May 2012, the Italian Ministry for Economic Development granted a three year extension to the Ombrina Mare exploration permit (BR269 GC), until 5 May 2015. The Directors consider this to be a positive sign in ongoing discussions with the Italian authorities regarding the issuance of a production concession for the Groups proposed development of the Ombrina Mare field.The Directors are currently exploring and undertaking various courses of action in order to seek a resolution of the current situation and will continue to do so in the coming months. These steps include ongoing negotiations with various government departments, taking legal action along with other oil companies and lobbying the Italian government for clarity over terms used in the Decree to allow the Group to continue with planned substantial investment and development of the asset.  42Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com5 Intangible assets (continued)Given the issues stated above, the Board have reviewed the current carrying value of 18.0m relating to the Ombrina Mare asset against certain criteria, including that set out within relevant accounting standards (IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources), and have concluded that no impairment of the Ombrina asset should be recognised. This conclusion is based upon the fact that the Group has received a 3 year extension of the exploration permit and the indicated resource at Ombrina Mare indicates that the asset has significant potential to the Group. The Directors therefore remain confident of being able to advance this asset into production.In May 2011, the Company agreed an 18 month extension to the first exploration period of the PSC with the Maltese Government, thus extending the first exploration period until mid-January 2013. Since 2008, the Company has completed a detailed G&G assessment of the area, in order to de-risk the prospects and verify the presence of technically and commercially valuable exploration drilling opportunities. With this objective in mind, in late 2011 the Company acquired 1,012 sq km of high resolution long offset 3D seismic data on the most prospective sector of Area 4. The Company believes that this 3D data will be fundamental to completing the G&G assessment and de-risking the exploration potential. A comprehensive CPR has been commissioned. The results of this study, which are expected early in the 3rd Quarter of 2012, will underpin the Companys strategy to seek a farm-in partner and progress the exploration of this asset. Based on this, the Board have reviewed the current carrying value of 4.79m relating to the Malta 4 asset against certain criteria, including that set out in the relevant accounting standards (IFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources), and have concluded that no impairment of the Malta 4 asset should be recognised. The conclusion is based upon the fact that the group had a valid claim over the Malta 4 license and the asset has significant potential to the Group. The Directors remain confident of being able to advance this asset through successful completion of the G&G assessment.  The value of intangible assets includes an amount of nil (2010: nil) relating to a proposed gas storage project at the depleted Cupoloni gas field. The balance for this asset was fully provided during the prior year.6 Capital commitments As at 31 December 2011, the Group had committed 1.81m (2010: 2.01m) in operational and exploration expenditure relating to various concessions. The above number represents all open/outstanding contracts and purchase orders.7 Segmental reporting In the opinion of the Directors, the operations of the Group companies comprise three operating segments conducting exploration, production, and corporate activities. The Group operates in one geographic area, being Mediterranean Europe. The Groups oil and gas revenues are generated entirely in Italy and result from sales to European based customers. 94% of Group revenue is generated from sales of gas and condensate to four customers (2010: 91%).The reportable segments have been identified on the basis that these operating segments form the main identifiable cost centres for the group as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM is defined as the Board of Directors. The top four customers contributed the following proportions to Group oil and gas revenues:2011 2010Customer 1 47% 77%Customer 2 25% 0%Customer 3 19% 7%Customer 4 3% 7%The primary financial statements presented reflect all the activities of these three operating segments.

The current tax receivable has arisen predominantly from VAT reimbursement which is receivable from the Italian government by the Italian subsidiary, Medoilgas Italia S.p.A. The non-current tax receivable relates to VAT recoverable in Italy of 699,000, which is not expected to be reimbursed in the next 12 month period. The recoverability of the current and non-current VAT receivable balances is due to be via a net reduction in taxation settlements made with the Italian tax authorities on charges to be incurred in the future as a result of tax liabilities arising from production activities. At 31 December 2011, there were receivables past due which have not been provided, since all amounts are within 6 months of being past due.

With the approval of an extraordinary resolution of the holders of the CLNs, the Company agreed to amend the deed poll constituting the CLNs to give the Company the right to convert the outstanding CLNs at its election into 21,061,225 Conversion Shares, at a price of 24 pence per Conversion Share. The Company elected to convert all of the outstanding CLNs.The original conversion prices of the CLNs and the Convertible Bonds were 40 pence and 50 pence respectively and the Company had no right to require conversion. The amendments to the terms and conversion prices of the CLNs and the Convertible Bonds were necessary to enable the Subscription and the Debt Cancellation to take place. The Conversion Shares were issued credited as fully paid, subject to the memorandum of association and Articles of the Company and rank pari passu in all respects with new ordinary shares then in issue, including the right to receive any future dividends and other distributions.The principal financial liabilities have been extinguished as follows:Group andCompany000Convertible bonds debt brought forward 5,389Convertible loan notes debt brought forward 5,378Total liability brought forward at 1 January 2011 10,767Accretion charge 426Foreign exchange (282)Gain on settlement recognised in equity (8,111)Conversion of debt into equity (2,800)Financial Liability carried forward at 31 December 2011 At each reporting date the embedded derivatives, being the conversion option and the conversion right, are measured at their fair value with changes in fair value recognised within profit or loss as they arise.

All financial assets and liabilities indicated above with a * are shown in the statement of financial position at their amortised costs, which approximates to underlying fair value. Financial instruments listed above valued at fair value are assessed as tier 3. Tier 3 means inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.Where carried at fair value through profit or loss as indicated by (*) the financial instruments are assessed as tier 2. A tier 2 classification means that inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2). All financial liabilities carried at fair value through the profit and loss were settled in the current year. Therefore no fair value adjustments have been recognised in the current period.Financial risk managementGeneral objectives, policies and processesThe Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining responsibility for them it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Groups finance function. The Board receive regular updates from our accounting and financial management through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below.The key financial instruments for the Company are the current receivables related to subsidiaries and as a result, Company reports are only included where relevant.Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales in relation to gas production. It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts in accordance with best local business practices, and seek external credit ratings where applicable and when available. Credit risk of existing customers is assessed when deemed necessary.Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with an acceptable rating are utilised. It is the Group policy that it endeavours to maintain substantial bank deposits and bills with financial institutions with Standard & Poors A rating or equivalent. The Group holds cash balanceswith Banca Intesa SanPaolo SpA (Standard & Poors rating BBB+/A-2), to meet minimum working capital requirements for the Italian operations.Interest rates received on deposit accounts held with HSBC, Banca Intesa SanPaolo and Deutsche Bank are between 0.25% and 1.04%  (31 December 2010: 0% to 0.6%), based on bank interest rates.The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk, although in certain isolated cases may take steps to mitigate such risks if it is sufficiently concentrated.Financial assets: AgeingGroup201100020100001 month 6,673 3,7702/3 months 736 4784/6 months 13 357,422 4,283The Group has not historically suffered defaults from its customers for onshore gas production. The Group faces credit risk through onshore gas sales to Gas Plus Italiana and joint venture cash calls to Edison and Gas Plus Italiana, arising from various joint venture projects where Medoilgas Italia SpA acts as operator. The Groups main credit risk exposure through its subsidiary Medoilgas Italia SpA, is with Repower Italia S.p.A. (Repower) which at present purchases the Groups entire offshore gas production from the Guendalina gas field which commenced gas production in Q4, 2011. Price risk under this contract is mitigated by the provision of a bank guarantee in favour of the Group in respect of a material proportion of forecast gas purchases under the contract. Management believes the credit risk currently faced by the Group is low given the high credit worthiness of Gas Plus Italiana, Edison and Repower. Gas Plus Italiana is a major Italian gas supply company listed on the Borsa Italiana and public filings indicate it has good creditworthiness.The Group from time to time reviews whether a greater utilisation of credit ratings would be appropriate. Given that much of the Groups trade receivables are under joint operating agreements, the security against joint venture assets provided by those agreements adequately mitigates any risk of default. At the reporting date, the Group does not envisage any losses from non-performance of existing counterparties. 50Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com18 Financial instruments  risk management (continued)It is considered that given the presently challenging macroeconomic position in the Eurozone and in Italy, credit risk has been elevated as at the reporting date, compared to the previous year end but that this risk has not had a material impact on earnings or shareholders equity. Management continues to monitor the financial and energy market conditions and will consider any steps required to mitigate associated risks to the Group.The Group seeks to maintain deposit accounts for its cash balances, primarily with banks which hold a high credit rating. The applicable interest rate on cash balances is also considered. Current bank deposits are held primarily with HSBC Bank plc and Deutsche Bank AG, with funds necessary for adequate working capital availability to the Italian operations held on deposit with Banca Intesa SanPaolo. Funds which are not expected to be required in the near term are placed on short-term (i.e. up to 90 days) deposit with fixed interest rates for the relevant term, which reduce the Groups exposure to interest rate risk. At the same time, management reviews the Groups forecast cashflows in order to ensure that the maximum level of interest is received for the available funds but without adversely affecting the working capital flexibility the Group requires. There is no material difference between the book value and fair value of the Groups cash and cash equivalents.A 1% interest rate movement does not have a material effect on the Groups financial assets and liabilities therefore no sensitivity analysis isprovided.Cash flow interest rate riskThe Group and Company are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from deposits of cash and cash equivalents with banks. The cash and cash equivalents balances maintained by the Group are proactively managed in order to ensure that the maximum level of interest is received for the available funds but without affecting the working capital flexibility the Group requires.There is no material difference between the book value and fair value of the Groups cash and cash equivalents.Foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world and because some of its major suppliers utilise contracts denominated in US dollars irrespective of the location where services are provided. Although its geographical spread reduces the Groups operational risk, the Groups net assets arising from such overseas operations are exposed to currency risk resulting in gains and losses on retranslation into Euro. Only in exceptional circumstances will the Group consider hedging its net investments in overseas operations as generally it does not consider that the reduction in foreign currency exposure warrants the cash flow risk created from such hedging techniques. It is the Groups policy to ensure that individual Group entities enter into local transactions in their functional currency wherever possible or acquire the relevant contract currency ahead of the expenditure obligation. The Group considers this policy minimises any unnecessary foreign exchange exposure.The Board continues to monitor the effectiveness of this policy on an ongoing basis through its approval of both corporate and capital expenditure budgets, review of the currency profile of cash balances, and management accounts.Part of the Groups borrowings, during the year ended 31 December 2011, was denominated in Sterling and the functional currency of the loan counterparty is the Euro. The Group is therefore exposed to changes in exchange rates. A total foreign exchange gain of 435,000 (2010: loss of 549,000) was recognised in the year in respect of the translation of monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in Euro.The proportion of cash and cash equivalent balances held in Euro as at 31 December 2011 was 36.4% (2010: 98%), USD 41.8%, GBP 21.8%. The former liabilities denominated in Sterling related to the convertible bonds and the convertible loan notes (10.767m) have been converted into equity after the financial restructuring completed on 10 May 2011. At 31 December 2011, the currency exposure of the Group was as follows:AUD000USD000GBP000EURO000Total000At 31 December 2011Cash and cash equivalents  1,548 807 1,348 3,703Trade and other receivables  330  3,389 3,719Trade and other payables (3) (2,880) (144) (7,190) (10,217)Other financial liabilities     Net financial assets/(liabilities) (3) (1,002) 663 (2,453) (2,795) weakens 10% (3) (1,102) 729 (2,453) (2,829) strengthens 10% (3) (902) 597 (2,453) (2,761)At 31 December 2010Cash and cash equivalents   8 2,802 2,810Trade and other receivables    1,426 1,426Trade and other payables (9) (242) (76) (2,842) (3,169)Other financial liabilities   (10,767) (9,584) (20,351)Net financial assets/(liabilities) (9) (242) (10,835) (8,198) (19,284) weakens 10% (10) (266) (11,918) (8,198) (20,392) strengthens 10% (8) (218) (9,752) (8,198) (18,175)Notes forming part of the financial statements continuedFor the year ended 31 December 2011 51Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSSignificant balances are held in foreign currencies. The Directors have considered the exposure resulting from movements in foreign exchange rates in relation to these amounts. A movement of 10% has been assessed and is disclosed in the table above.Liquidity riskLiquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.The Groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain readily available cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected requirements. See further information on Going Concern in Note 1.Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced monthly. These are reviewed regularly by management and the Board to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists.The contractual undiscounted amounts of financial liabilities are repayable as follows:Group Company20110002010 00020110002010 0001 month 3,705 286 84 672/3 months 6,094 4,172 186 2684/6 months 56 4  6/12 months 362 21,704 19,433 20,641In more than one year but not more than two years    _10,217 26,166 19,703 20,976In respect of the Company, included in Euro amounts receivable within one year are amounts due from group companies totalling 17 .0m (2010: 19.0m).Price risk Gas sales revenue is subject to energy market price risk. The Groups gas revenues are sourced from the sale of gas under term supplycontracts.Estimated production volumes for sales of onshore gas production are set out in the contracts. The applicable gas price for each month is set according to a formula which is linked to the oil price that applies a constant to the average oil price from fuel oil, gas oil and crude oil (Brent) prices over each of the 9 months prior to the actual month of gas delivery. The oil prices which are applied in the formula are sourced from the Platts Oilgram Price Report (average of the highest and lowest for each oil type in each of the 9 prior months) in US$ and convertible to Euro value by reference to the average monthly US$/ exchange rate, which is in the actual month of gas supply, as published by the European Central Bank. Given the gas price formula for onshore gas sales is based on an oil price formula which takes an average measure of the prior 9 month period, any short-term material oil price fluctuations are likely to be mitigated. At present, the Group does not intend to hedge oil price risk in the short term.The current offshore gas sale contract in respect of the Groups interest in the Guendalina gas field terminates on 30 September 2013. This contract is similar to the Groups contracts for the sale of onshore gas production and it is set to a benchmark of Italian energy market prices identified by a specific formula, in which the price is calculated by reference to oil-linked benchmarks and the /$ exchange rate. Defaults and breachesThere have been no defaults or breaches in respect of current and non-current liabilities recognised at the reporting date.Capital disclosuresThe Group seeks to maintain sufficient capital to fund its growth and safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern. The primary objective of the Group is to maximise shareholder value, which from a capital management perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure that is most suited to the Groups size, project and strategic priorities, as well as underlying business risk.Currently, the Group does not pay dividends, focusing instead, on delivering capital growth by developing its exploration portfolio and its Italian development assets, to optimise future returns. As at 31 December 2011 and the date of this report, the capital employed by the Group to fund projects is comprised solely of equity attributable to shareholders. Management will continue to review the scope to apply other sources of capital and equity finance, such as potential farm outs, to support key projects. The details and movements in the Companys share capital are set out in Note 20. 52Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com19 Provisions for liabilities and charges Decommissioning 000Amounts payable to employees/Other provisions 000 Total 000At 1 January 2010 7,146 193 7,339New provisions and changes in estimates (1,421) 46 (1,375)Utilisation 47 (80) (33)Unwinding of discount factor 738  738At 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011 6,510 159 6,669Changes in estimates (468)  45 (423)New provision 1,156 409 1,565Utilisation  (45) (45)Unwinding of discount factor 610  610At 31 December 2011 7,808 568 8,376The decommissioning provision is the discounted present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning the Groups oil and gas production facilities in Italy. The discount factor used is 10%. The Group makes provision for the cost of decommissioning its producing wells at the completion of their useful lives. There are in excess of 30 wells for which provision has been made. Individual final decommissioning costs vary. Decommissioning of the wells is anticipated over a 10 year period with additional provision to be made as new production wells are brought on stream. The time frame for decommissioning is based upon the projected production profile and remaining proved and probable reserves. The costs of decommissioning both onshore and offshore wells are certified by independent qualified engineers andspecialists. The decommissioning provision for the year ended 31 December 2011 has decreased by 0.468m, due primarily to an extension in the independently certified forecast timetable for the decommissioning and abandonment of the Groups onshore producing fields. A new provision (1.156m) was made in the period following the commencement of production from the Guendalina onshore gas field.Amounts payable to employees are in respect of the Groups estimated liability to employees when they cease employment.A provision for 409,000 (2010: nil) has been recognized in relation to the Groups potential liability through the subsidiary Malta Oil Pty Ltd for the relinquishment of the Medjerda licence in Tunisia.20 Share capitalIssued and fully paid2011Number20110002010Number2010000Ordinary shares of 0.01p eachAt 1 January 38,912,736 11,285 38,912,736 11,285Share consolidation  (10,721)Issued in the period  fundraising 333,333,333 3,866  Issued in the period  settlement of debt 40,919,558 469  Issue of shares  commission shares 15,952,083 159  At 31 December 429,117,710 5,058 38,912,736 11,285On 10 May 2011, the Group raised 20m before expenses (approximately 19.1m net of cash transaction expenses) by the subscription for 333,333,333 new ordinary shares in the Company (the Subscription) at 6 pence each (Subscription Price). In addition, the Company agreed terms with the Bank of Scotland Plc (BoS), Stark Select Asset Master Limited (Stark Select) as holder of the convertible bonds (Convertible Bonds), and with holders of the convertible loan notes (CLNs), as a result of which, all outstanding amounts due to the BoS under the BoS bank facility were settled and all outstanding Convertible Bonds and CLNs were converted into new ordinary shares (together, the Conversion Shares) of the Company at a price of 24 pence per new ordinary share (together, the Group Recapitalisation). As a result of the Group Recapitalisation, the Group does not have any outstanding financial debt.The nominal value of the existing ordinary shares as at 31 December 2010, was 20 pence. The issue of new shares at the Subscription Price therefore required the adjustment of the nominal value of each of the Companys ordinary shares to 1 penny, rather than 20 pence.The gross proceeds of the 20m equity raise were used to fund the Groups required capital expenditure for the Guendalina project (MOG: 20% interest), settlement of the bank facility with BoS, the Group Recapitalisation expenses and the Groups working capital needs.Notes forming part of the financial statements continuedFor the year ended 31 December 2011 53Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.comBUSINESSREVIEWCORPORATEGOVERNANCEFINANCIALSTATEMENTSConversion of convertible bonds and convertible notesThe holder of all of the outstanding Convertible Bonds, Stark Select, agreed to convert the whole of the outstanding principal amount of its Convertible Bonds into 19,858,333 Conversion Shares at a price of 24 pence per Conversion Share.With the approval of an extraordinary resolution of the holders of the CLNs, the Company agreed to amend the deed poll constituting the CLNs to give the Company the right to convert the outstanding CLNs at its election into 21,061,225 Conversion Shares, at a price of 24 pence per Conversion Share. The Company elected to convert all of the outstanding CLNs.The original conversion prices of the CLNs and the Convertible Bonds were 40 pence and 50 pence respectively and the Company had no right to require conversion. The amendments to the terms and conversion prices of the CLNs and the Convertible Bonds were necessary to enable the Subscription and the Debt Cancellation to take place. The Conversion Shares were issued credited as fully paid, subject to the memorandum of association and Articles of the Company and rank pari passu in all respects with new ordinary shares then in issue, including the right to receive any future dividends and other distributions.Share consolidationThe Subscription Price of 6 pence was below the nominal value of the ordinary shares of the Company, of 20 pence. As Company law prohibits the issue of shares at a price less than their nominal value, in order to effect the Subscription, a share consolidation was undertaken whereby each ordinary share of the Company was subdivided into one new ordinary share with nominal value of 1 penny and one deferred share with nominal value of 19 pence (the Share Consolidation).The Share Consolidation resulted in 38,912,736 new ordinary shares and 38,912,736 deferred shares (the Deferred Shares) being in issue immediately following the Share Consolidation but before the completion of the Group Recapitalisation.After the implementation of the Share Consolidation the nominal value of each new ordinary share was one twentieth of that of each existing ordinary share. Each new ordinary share has the same rights (including voting and dividend rights and rights on a return of capital) as each ordinary share existing prior to completion of the Group Recapitalisation.The rights attaching to the Deferred Shares, which have not been admitted to trading on AIM, are minimal, thereby rendering them effectively valueless. The rights attaching to the Deferred Shares are summarised as follows:\t they do not entitle holders to receive any dividend or other distribution or to receive notice of, attend, speak at or vote at general meetings of the Company;\t on a return of assets on a winding up, they will only entitle the holder to the amounts paid up on such shares after the repayment of 10m per New Ordinary Share;\t they authorise the Company to appoint any person to execute on behalf of the holders of the Deferred Shares a transfer of such shares to the Company, or such person as the Company may nominate as custodian, without any payment therefore and without the sanction of the holders of the Deferred Shares; and\t the creation and issue of further shares which rank equally or in priority to the Deferred Shares or the passing of a resolution of the Company to cancel the Deferred Shares or to effect a reduction in capital shall not constitute a modification or abrogation of their rights.There are no immediate plans to purchase or cancel the Deferred Shares, but the Company may seek to do so in the future.The Groups policy is to utilise options as part of the management reward structure. Option terms are set by agreement with an incoming executive or based upon the recommendations of the remuneration committee to the Board of Directors, for existing management. No options have been exercised in the year (2010: none).21 Notes supporting cash flow statementCash and cash equivalents comprise:Group Company20110002010 00020110002010 000Cash available on demand 3,703 2,810 2,464 1,221 54Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com22 Share-based paymentThis note is presented in Sterling, unless otherwise stated, as this is the currency in which shares are issued and options are priced.The Company has previously operated an equity-settled share based remuneration scheme for employees and contractors in the form of an unapproved scheme.

These are set out below:a)  Convertible debt (comprising convertible bonds and convertible loan notes) which had a carrying value of 10.9m was extinguished by the issue of 40.9m ordinary shares with a fair value of 2.8m. This has given rise to an amount of 8.1m being recognised as a capital contribution by current shareholders.b)  An IFRS 2 charge has arisen on the issue of 15.9m new nil cost shares to parties involved in the Group Recapitalisation transaction in the period. The amount of the charge was 2.2m which has been recognised in the share premium account as a cost of issuing shares.25 Related partiesThe Company has entered into a number of unsecured related party transactions with its subsidiary undertakings. The transactions carried out between the Company and its subsidiary undertakings are for short and long term financing, details of such transactions and amounts owed to and from these entities are provided in Notes 15, 16 and 19.Information regarding the remuneration of key management personnel and their connected persons is disclosed in Note 10.Group recapitalisationAs part of the Group Recapitalisation, the following related party transactions occurred:Immediately prior to the Group Recapitalisation, Michael Bonte-Friedheim, a Director, held 338,000 ordinary shares.

MBF Strategy Limited also held warrants over 325,000 ordinary shares exercisable at 45p per ordinary share. MBF Strategy Limited subscribed 150,000 for new ordinary shares at 6p per share (the Subscription Price), as part of the Group Recapitalisation (Subscription Shares).Chris Kelsall, a Director of the Company, subscribed 20,000 for Subscription Shares at the Subscription Price.

With the exception of Michael Bonte-Friedheim in respect of his own participation in the Conversion Shares and the Subscription Shares and Chris Kelsall in respect of his own participation in the Subscription Shares, the Directors considered, having consulted with WH Ireland, the Companys nominated adviser at the time of the Group Recapitalisation, that the terms of the Conversion and the Subscription insofar as they relate to such related parties were fair and reasonable insofar as Shareholders were concerned.In connection with the services that Merlin Partners LLP (Merlin), Miles Donnelly, Michael Seymour and Matthew Clarke provided to the Company in arranging the Subscription, the Company agreed, conditional upon completion of the Subscription, to pay to such persons a commission equal to 5 per cent of funds raised from Subscription Shares issued to such persons and Subscribers introduced by them and 1.5 per cent of funds raised from Subscription Shares issued to existing Shareholders, holders of Convertible Bonds, holders of Convertible Notes or other Subscribers introduced by the Company (Services Agreement). Matthew Clarke was founding partner and, immediately prior to the Group Recapitalisation, controlled Merlin.
